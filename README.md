# Building a Social Network with ASP.NET Core 9.0, React 19, and React Query

This repository contains the code for a social network application built using ASP.NET Core 9.0, React 19, and React Query, following the Clean Architecture and CQRS/Mediator pattern. This project is based on the Udemy course taught by Neil Cummings.

## Course Overview

This course aims to provide a practical, hands-on experience in building a full-stack web application. It covers a wide range of topics, from setting up the development environment to deploying the application to Azure.

**Key Learning Points:**

* **ASP.NET Core 9.0:** Building a multi-project solution using Clean Architecture and the CQRS/Mediator pattern.
* **React 19:** Utilizing React with TypeScript, React Router, React Hook Form, and Zod.
* **React Query:** Managing server state with React Query.
* **Authentication:** Implementing ASP.NET Core Identity for authentication.
* **UI Development:** Creating a user-friendly interface with Semantic UI.
* **Data Handling:** Implementing paging, sorting, and filtering.
* **Real-time Communication:** Using SignalR for chat functionality.
* **Cloud Deployment:** Publishing the application to Azure.
* **Development Tools:** Using Visual Studio Code, .NET CLI, and create-react-app.
* **Automapper:** Using AutoMapper in ASP.NET Core
* **Photo Uploads:** Adding photo upload widget and user profile pages.
